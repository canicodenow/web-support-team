                </h1>
                <p>To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device.
                    Most websites do this.</p>

                <h3>What are cookies?</h3>

                <p>A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit
                    the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language,
                    font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep
                    re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p>

                <h3>How do we use cookies?</h3>

                <p>We use cookies to help improve our website. They improve things by:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        measuring how you use the website so we can make sure it meets your needs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        counting how many times, and from what location, pages are shared
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        remembering if you have agreed (or not) to our use of cookies on this site.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Some videos and audio files embedded in our pages, if you play them, use third-party cookies to
                    anonymously gather statistics on how you got there and what videos you visited.</p>

                <p>Enabling these cookies is not strictly necessary for the website to work but it will provide you with
                    a better browsing experience. You can delete or block these cookies, but if you do that some
                    features of this site may not work as intended.</p>

                <p>We can’t personally identify you using the data we save in cookies. They’re just here to make the
                    site work better for you. Indeed, you can manage and/or delete these small pieces of text as you
                    wish.</p>
