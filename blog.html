                <h1>
                    Accessibility statements for schools and academies
                </h1>
                <p>On 23 September 2020 <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/contents/made">new
                        regulations</a> came into force aimed at improving website accessibility for public bodies.
                    Whilst schools and academies are not covered by all the accessibility requirements, they must still
                    publish an Accessibility Statement and meet some aspects of the regulations.</p>

                <p>For schools, this means that the content on your website that people need to use in order to use your
                    services <strong>must be accessible</strong>. This could include content such as registration and
                    application forms, term dates or uniform details.</p>

                <p>You must also be aware of the use of PDFs and documents on your website. It is difficult to make
                    documents like these accessible, so the best option is usually to make this content available on an
                    accessible web page.</p>

                <h3>
                    What is an Accessibility Statement?
                </h3>

                <p>You need to publish a webpage explaining to users how accessible your website is and detail any
                    aspects that are not accessible to all users. The accessibility statement must be written in plain
                    English, as most users will not be experts.</p>

                <h3>
                    What should it include?
                </h3>
                <p>Your statement needs to cover:
                <ul>
                    <li>whether your website or mobile app is ‘fully’, ‘partially’ or ‘not’ compliant with accessibility
                        standards</li>
                    <li>if it’s not fully compliant, which parts of your website or mobile app do not currently meet
                        accessibility standards and why (for example, because they are exempt, or it would be a
                        disproportionate burden to fix things)</li>
                    <li>how people can get alternatives to content that’s not accessible to them</li>
                    <li>how to contact you to report accessibility problems - and a link to the website that they can
                        use if they’re not happy with your response.</li>
                    </p>
                </ul>

                <h3>
                    Can I use an online tool to create one?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, but these may not cover everything you need to include in your statement. GOV.UK have <a
                        href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website">published
                        a sample statement</a>, which is a better option, but to produce a fully compliant statement you
                    do need to have an understanding of what makes a website accessible or not. Without this technical
                    knowledge, it is unlikely that you will be able to explain this to your users.</p>

                <h3>
                    How can the Web Support Team help me?
                </h3>
